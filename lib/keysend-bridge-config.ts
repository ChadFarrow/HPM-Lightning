/**
 * Keysend Bridge Configuration
 * 
 * This file configures the Alby Hub NWC connection that acts as a bridge
 * for wallets that don't support keysend payments (like Coinos).
 * 
 * SECURITY: The NWC connection string contains sensitive credentials.
 * Store it in environment variables, NOT in code!
 * 
 * To set up your Alby Hub bridge:
 * 1. Open your Alby Hub dashboard
 * 2. Go to Apps â†’ Connections
 * 3. Create a new NWC connection
 * 4. Copy the connection string (starts with nostr+walletconnect://)
 * 5. Add to your .env.local file: ALBY_HUB_BRIDGE_NWC=your_connection_string
